# GraphQL server
This is an express front end querying SpaceX's api and serving its data through GraphQL.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`
Runs the express server on localhost port 5000 with hot reload capabilities

### `npm run dev`
Runs two scripts which allow the server and the client (located in another repo) to start up at the same time with one command.
